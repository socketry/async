# ![Async](logo.svg)

Async is a composable asynchronous I/O framework for Ruby based on [io-event](https://github.com/socketry/io-event) and [timers](https://github.com/socketry/timers).

> "Lately I've been looking into `async`, as one of my projects – [tus-ruby-server](https://github.com/janko/tus-ruby-server) – would really benefit from non-blocking I/O. It's really beautifully designed." *– [janko](https://github.com/janko)*

[![Development Status](https://github.com/socketry/async/workflows/Development/badge.svg)](https://github.com/socketry/async/actions?workflow=Development)

## Features

  - Scalable event-driven I/O for Ruby. Thousands of clients per process\!
  - Light weight fiber-based concurrency. No need for callbacks\!
  - Multi-thread/process containers for parallelism.
  - Growing eco-system of event-driven components.

## Usage

Please see the [project documentation](https://socketry.github.io/async).
