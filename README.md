## Motivation

Several years ago, I was hosting websites on a server in my garage. Back then, my ADSL modem was very basic, and I wanted to have a DNS server which would resolve to an internal IP address when the domain itself resolved to my public IP. Thus was born [RubyDNS]. This project [was originally built on](https://github.com/ioquatix/rubydns/tree/v0.8.5) top of [EventMachine], but a lack of support for [IPv6 at the time](https://github.com/ioquatix/rubydns/issues/45) and [other problems](https://github.com/ioquatix/rubydns/issues/14), meant that I started looking for other options. Around that time [Celluloid] was picking up steam. I had not encountered actors before and I wanted to learn more about it. So, [I reimplemented RubyDNS on top of Celluloid](https://github.com/ioquatix/rubydns/tree/v0.9.0) and this eventually became the first stable release.

Moving forward, I refactored the internals of RubyDNS into [Celluloid::DNS]. This rewrite helped solidify the design of RubyDNS and to a certain extent it works. However, [unfixed bugs and design problems](https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid/pull/710) in Celluloid meant that RubyDNS 2.0 was delayed by almost 2 years. I wasn't happy releasing it with known bugs and problems. After sitting on the problem for a while, and thinking about possible solutions, I decided to build a small event reactor using [nio4r] and [timers], the core parts of [Celluloid::IO] which made it work so well. The result is this project.

In addition, there is a [similarly designed C++ library of the same name](https://github.com/kurocha/async). These two libraries share similar design principles, but are different in some areas due to the underlying semantic differences of the languages.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "async"
```

And then execute:

	$ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

	$ gem install async

## Usage

`Async::Reactor` is the top level IO reactor, and runs multiple tasks asynchronously. The reactor itself is not thread-safe, so you'd typically have [one reactor per thread or process](https://github.com/socketry/async-container).

An `Async::Task` runs using a `Fiber` and blocking operations e.g. `sleep`, `read`, `write` yield control until the operation can succeed.

The design of this core library is deliberately simple in scope. Additional libraries provide asynchronous networking, process management, etc. It's likely you will prefer to depend on `async-io` for actual wrappers around `IO` and `Socket`.

### Main Entry Points

#### `Async::Reactor.run`

The highest level entry point is `Async::Reactor.run`. It's useful if you are building a library and you want well defined asynchronous semantics.

```ruby
def run_server
  Async::Reactor.run do |task|
    # ... acccept connections
  end
end
```

If `Async::Reactor.run(&block)` happens within an existing reactor, it will schedule an asynchronous task and return. If `Async::Reactor.run(&block)` happens outside of an existing reactor, it will create a reactor, schedule the asynchronous task, and block until it completes. The task is scheduled by calling `Async::Reactor.async(&block)`.

This puts the power into the hands of the client, who can either have blocking or non-blocking behaviour by explicitly wrapping the call in a reactor (or not). The cost of using `Async::Reactor.run` is minimal for initialization/server setup, but is not ideal for per-connection tasks.

#### `Async::Task#async`

If you can guarantee you are running within a task, and have access to it (e.g. via an argument), you can efficiently schedule new tasks using the `Async::Task#async(&block)` method.

```ruby
def do_request(task: Task.current)
  task.async do
    # ... do some actual work
  end
end
```

This method effectively creates a child task. It's the most efficient way to schedule a task. The task is executed until the first blocking operation, at which point it will yield control and `#async` will return. The result of this method is the task itself.

### Reactor Tree

`Async::Reactor` and `Async::Task` form nodes in a tree. Reactors and tasks can spawn children tasks. When you invoke `Async::Reactor#async`, the parent task is determined by calling `Async::Task.current?` which uses fiber local storage. A slightly more efficient method is to use `Async::Task#async`, which uses `self` as the parent task.

When invoking `Async::Reactor#stop`, you will stop *all* children tasks of that reactor. Tasks will raise `Async::Stop` if they are in a blocking operation. In addition, it's possible to only stop a sub-tree by issuing `Async::Task#stop`, which will stop that task and all it's children (recursively). When you design a server, you should return the task back to the caller. They can use this task to stop the server if needed, independently of any other unrelated tasks within the reactor, and it will correctly clean up all related tasks.

### Resource Management

In order to ensure your resources are cleaned up correctly, make sure you wrap resources appropriately, e.g.:

```ruby
Async::Reactor.run do
  socket = connect(remote_address) # May raise Async::Stop

  begin
    socket.write(...) # May raise Async::Stop
    socket.read(...) # May raise Async::Stop
  ensure
    socket.close
  end
end
```

As tasks run synchronously until they yield back to the reactor, you can guarantee this model works correctly. While in theory `IO#autoclose` allows you to automatically close file descriptors when they go out of scope via the GC, it may produce unpredictable behavour (exhaustion of file descriptors, flushing data at odd times), so it's not recommended.

## Supported Ruby Versions

This library aims to support and is [tested against][travis] the following Ruby
versions:

* Ruby 2.0+
* JRuby 9.1.6.0+

If something doesn't work on one of these versions, it's a bug.

This library may inadvertently work (or seem to work) on other Ruby versions,
however support will only be provided for the versions listed above.

If you would like this library to support another Ruby version or
implementation, you may volunteer to be a maintainer. Being a maintainer
entails making sure all tests run and pass on that implementation. When
something breaks on your implementation, you will be responsible for providing
patches in a timely fashion. If critical issues for a particular implementation
exist at the time of a major release, support for that Ruby version may be
dropped.
