In other words, you should not design your programs to expect exceptions from `#wait` as a normal flow control, and prefer to catch known exceptions within the task itself and return a result that captures the intention of the failure, e.g. a `TimeoutError` might simply return `nil` or `false` to indicate that the operation did not generate a valid result (as a timeout was an expected outcome of the internal operation in this case).
